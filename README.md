`shops` is a simple command-line tool written in [Go](https://golang.org)
that helps you simplify the way you manage configuration across a set of
machines.

> `shops` is your configuration management tool of choice when Chef,
> Puppet, Ansible are all too complicated and all you really want to do is
> run a bunch of regular shell against a set of hosts.

`shops` basically lets you (_the oeprator_) run a specification against one
or mote targets. Targets can either be local or remote and the syntax of a
target is:

```
type://[<user>@]<hostname>[:<port>]
```

For local targets, only thee type is required, e.g: `local://`.

For remote targets, the user and port are optional and if not specified in the
target they default to the `-u/--user` and `-p/--port` flags respectively.

## Getting Started

### Install from releases

You can install `shops` by simply downloading the latest version from our
[Release](https://github.com/prologic/shops/releases) page for your platform
and placing the binary in your `$PATH`.

For convenience you can run one of the following which will download and
install  the latest release binary into `/usr/local/bin`:

For Linux x86_64:

```console
curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/prologic/shops/releases/latest | grep browser_download_url | grep Linux_x86_64 | cut -d '"' -f 4 | wget -q -O - -i - | tar -xv shops && mv shops /usr/local/bin/shops
```

For MacOS x86_64:

```console
curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/prologic/shops/releases/latest | grep browser_download_url | grep Darwin_x86_64 | cut -d '"' -f 4 | wget -q -O - -i - | tar -xv shops && mv shops /usr/local/bin/shops
```

### Install from source

To install `shops` you can run `go get` directly:

```#!console
go get github.com/prologic/shops
```

> __NOTE:__ Be sure to have `$GOBIN` (_if not empty_) or your `$GOPATH/bin`
>           in your `$PATH`.
>           See [Compile and install packages and dependencies](https://golang.org/cmd/go/#hdr-Compile_and_install_packages_and_dependencies)

Or grab the source code and build:

```#!console
git clone https://github.com/prologic/shops.git
cd shops
go build
```

And optionally run `go install` to place the binary `shops` in your `$GOBIN`
or `$GOPATH/bin` (_again see note above_).

## Usage

Using `shops` is quite simple. The basic usage is as follows:

```#!console
shops -f /path/to/spec.yml <host1> <host2> <hostN>
```

For example running the included `test.yml` specification file which can be
found in the `./testdata` directory in the source tree as well as other examples:

```#!console
shops -f ./testdata/sample.yml 10.0.0.50
```

Will perform the will perform the following:

- Copy `README.md` to `/root/README.md` on the server
- Ensure `/tmp/foo` exists
- Check the uptime of the server and display it.

Example:

```#!console
$ ./shops -f ./testdata/sample.yml 10.0.0.50
10.0.0.50:22:
  README.md -> /root/README.md ‚úÖ
  Ensure /root/foo exists ‚úÖ -> /root/foo
  Ensure sshbox is running ‚úÖ ->
  Check Uptime ‚úÖ -> 13:58:27 up 3 days,  1:38,  0 users,  load average: 0.00, 0.00, 0.00

//  //   '--;
'   \     | ^
     ^    ^
```

> Yes, it really does print a Pony on success! ü§£

### Examples and Use Cases

> Yes! This is a serious tool and effort to build something __I__ want to use on a daily basis to help automate various DevOps / System tasks
> without having to go learn a complicated / non-trivial DSL of some description and all sorts of features I just don't need. Hopefully you find
> this a useful tool to add to your toolbelt too! ü§ó

Please puruse the [Examples](/examples) where I will place real-live examples of various types of tasks over time. Mostly these are biaed towards my home infrastructure (_a little server room with a 22RU rack cabinet and server gear_). If you end up using `shops` in your infrastructure, even if it's just a Raspbeery Pi, feel free to submit PR(s) to add useful examples adn use-cases here too! üôá‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

### Authentication

Remote targets are operated on via the SSH protocol using the `ssh://` type
which is implifed by default or if the target looks like it might be a hostname
or host:port pair.

Right now the only supported authentication methods are:

- SSH Agent

This means you **must** have a locally running `ssh-agent` and it **must**
have the identities you intend ot use to operate on your remote targets.

You can list these with `ssh-add -l`. If you do not have any listed this is
likely the most common cause of "authentication failure" errors.

There is an issue (#9) in the backlog to address adding support for other
authentication mechanisms:

- Password based auth with secure prompts
- Key based auth by providing an identity file and securely prompting for
  passphrase if applicable.

## Specification File Format

The specification file format is a simple YAML file with the following
structure:

```#!yaml
---
veresion: 1

files:
  - source: foo
    target: /tmp/foo

funcs:
  foo: |
    echo "I am a function!"

items:
  - name: Check #1
    check: true
    actino: foo
```

A valid spec consists of a number of top-level keys:

- `version` -- Which for the moment is ignored, but _might_ be used to version
               the configuration file for future enhancements in a backwards
               compatible way.
- `env`     -- Environment variables defined as a map of keys and values
               (_order is preserved_) and shell interpolation  is supported.
               Shell interpolation occurs on the target(s), not locally.
               Variables can be overridden with the `-e/--env` flag with the
               form `KEY[=<value>]`. If value is ommitted the value is taken
               from the local environment where `shops` is run.
- `files`   -- Declares one or more files or directories to be copied to each
               target host. Directories are copied recursively. Currently no
               checks are performed, but this is planned.
- `funcs`   -- A mapping of function name to the function's body. There is no
               need to write the function name with `foo() { ... }` as the
               `shops` runners will do this automatically when injecting
               functions into the session(s).
- `items`   -- One or more items of configuration to be applied to each target
               host. Each item declares a "check" and "action". Checks and
               actions are written in regular shell. If a check fails, the
               action is run to correct the failed state. If all checks pass,
               no actions are run.
